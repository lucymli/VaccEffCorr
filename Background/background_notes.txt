- From Sadoff & Wittes (2007) JID:
    - A specific surrogate of protection is a correlate of risk for which both of the following must have been shown in a randomized clinical trial: (1) the vaccine group had a significantly higher percentage of protected individuals than the comparator group and (2) in both the vaccine and control group, a certain quantitative level of a specific immune response was reached in the protected subjects but not in those unprotected (breakthroughs). A general surrogate of protection must have been demonstrated to be a specific surrogate in enough different settings and populations to allow generalizations to untested populations.
    - First is the Prentice criterion [2]: a marker can serve as a surrogate of protection if a mathematical relationship between the level of the marker and the probability of contracting disease fully explains the probability of contracting the disease in both the vaccine and control groups.First is the Prentice criterion [2]: a marker can serve as a surrogate of protection if a mathematical relationship between the level of the marker and the probability of contracting disease fully explains the probability of contracting the disease in both the vaccine and control groups.

    -  We refer to an immunological measurement that predicts a clinical end point in some population as a [Correlate of Risk] CoR.
    - A [Surrogate of Protection] SoP is a CoR that reliably predicts a vaccine's level of protective efficacy on the basis of contrasts in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups' immunological measurements.
    - The first approach identifies a SoP as a surrogate end point that satisfies the Prentice criterion [16], an empirical criterion that can be directly assessed with the data available from a standard efficacy trial. The Prentice criterion requires that the observed protective effect of the vaccine can be completely explained in a statistical model by the immunological measurements. The Prentice surrogate definition is most useful for immunological measurements that have substantial variability among control subjects, because this provides a basis for comparing the immune-response effect on risk in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.
    - A second approach for assessing a level 1 SoP is based on the principal surrogate framework of causal inference [18â€“21]. In this framework, potential outcomes are imagined that represent what would occur to an individual under each potential condition of randomization to the vaccine and control groups. An immunological measurement is considered to be a level 1 SoP if (1) groups of vaccinees with absent or the lowest response levels have a risk equal to that had they not been vaccinated and (2) groups of vaccinees with sufficiently high immune response levels have a risk lower than that had they not been vaccinated. Because this definition compares risk among groups with identical characteristics except for vaccination status, any difference is directly attributable to vaccine and, thus, is a causal effect [19].
